            SPIFFE (Secure Production Infrastructure Framework For Everyone) is an open source framework that aims
            to provide a secure identity, and a means to prove that identity, to every workload in a modern production
            environment no matter where it is running.
        </p>
        <p>
            Modern design patterns and practices such as microservices, container orchestrators and cloud computing 
            have led to production environments that are increasingly dynamic and heterogenous. Conventional security 
            practices (such as network policies that only allow traffic between particular IPs) struggle to scale 
            under this complexity, and a first class identity framework for workloads in an organisation becomes
            necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            Further, developers are now expected to understand and play a role in how applications are deployed and 
            managed in production, and Operations teams require deeper visibility into the applications that are being
            managed. As we move to a more evolved security stance, we must offer better tools to both teams so they 
            can play an active role in building securable applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            The SPIFFE project will provide both a <i>specification for</i>, and open source <i>reference implementation of</i>
            a framework for bootstraping and issuing identity to services accross a heterogenous hosting environment.
        </p>

        <h6 class="main-usage-title">Design goals of SPIFFE include:</h6>
        <ul class="about-lists">
            <li><p>
                <strong>Flexible Bootstrap.</strong>
                Identity is about trust and that trust needs to be bootstrapped. The system should
                have multiple mechanisms including being able to hook into hardware security mechanisms (such as TPMs)
                as that makes sense.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                <strong>Easy to use.</strong>
                Cryptography can be very difficult to use and even more difficult to use correctly. SPIFFE will provide
                automated API driven mechanisms for automatically issuing, verifying and rotating identity documents.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                <strong>Wide Integration.</strong>
                The more frameworks and tools that build in support for SPIFFE the more useful it 
                will be.  Built in support in RPC/micro-service frameworks, storage systems and orchestrators will 
                multiply its usefulness.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                <strong>Reliable.</strong>
                The single points of failures in the system should be minimized and the system should degrade gracefully
                when any SPOF is down.  All “steady state” operations shouldn’t have requirements off of a specific node.
                This precludes any centralized signing/verification service.
            </p></li>
            
            <li><p>
                <strong>Scoped trust roots.</strong>
                While PKI may used as part of the solution, there should be no hardcoded, global 
                trust roots as we see in the web browser world.  It is up to users to explicitly decide which roots 
                they will trust for which identities. Typically, these roots will be set per organization.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                <strong>Federatable.</strong>
                It should be possible to use these identity mechanisms across organizations. However, federation trust
                will have to be explicitly configured.  The nitty gritty of how to establish this trust may be out of
                scope for the first cut of these specifications.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                <strong>Legacy Friendly.</strong>
                Users should be able to apply SPIFFE without rewriting applications or moving them to a new management 
                system.  It should be possible to adapt this system as separable infrastructure to secure existing systems
                with little or no code change.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                <strong>Container Friendly.</strong>
                The system should work well in dynamically orchestrated containerized environments.
            </p></li>
            <li><p>
                <strong>Minimal Knowledge.</strong>
                A compromised machine should only expose any secrets for workloads that happen to be running on that machine.
            </p></li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>
            SPIFFE allows organisations to employ more robust secuity tooling by ensuring all running workloads
            within an organisation are issued an identity and the means to prove that identity to other running
            workloads.
        </p>
        <p>
            The initial release of SPIFFE is focused on issuing <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/docs/vsid">Verifiable Service Identity 
            Documents</a> (VSIDs). In practice VSIDs are a specially formatted X.509 leaf certificate that allow a 
            workload to assert identity, and set of root or intermediate certificates to allow third parties verify them.
        </p>

        <h6 class="main-usage-title">Examples of how SPIFFE VSIDs can be used:</h6>
        <ul class="about-lists">
            <li><p>Allowing two workloads to establish a mTLS connection</p></li>
            <li><p>Providing public key certificates to be consumed by service proxies such as nginx, Envoy and Linkerd</p></li>
            <li><p>Providing public key certificates to allow a service to communicate with a central secret store (such as Vault)</p></li>
            <li><p>Audit exactly what systems are running on which nodes in a production infrastructure</p></li>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>
            Both the specification for SPIFFE and the reference implementation are currently under active development, led by a set
            of design partners from a number of organisations including Google, Dropbox and Twillio. Read  more on
