As an early stage project, SPIFFE is guided by a small but active community.

## SIGs
SPIFFE encompasses many projects, organized into [SIGs](sig-list.md). Some communication has moved into SIG-specific channels - see a given SIG subdirectory for details.

## Social Media
SPIFFE has a burgeoning social media presence. We encourage you to follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SPIFFEio) feed.

## Slack
Most real-time discussions happen within SPIFFE's [Slack channel](https://spiffe.slack.com).

## Mailing Lists
Development announcements and discussions appear in the following [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/spiffe.io/forum/#!forum/dev-discussion) (send e-mail to `dev-discussion@spiffe.io`). Users trade notes in the following [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/spiffe.io/forum/#!forum/user-discussion) (send e-mail to `user-discussion@spiffe.io`).

## Issues
If you have a question about SPIFFE or have a problem using it, please start with the [troubleshooting guide]<TODO>. If that doesn't answer your questions, or if you think you found a bug, please [file an issue]<TODO>.

## Meetings
While each [SIG](https://github.com/spiffe/community/blob/master/sig-list.md) maintains its own meeting cadence, the SPIFFE community at-large gets together on the last Friday of each calendar month from 10:30-2:00pm PST (Map that to your local time with this [timezone table](https://www.google.com/search?q=1030+am+in+pst)). While such meetings can be attended via video/audio, we encourage community members to join in-person, as well. If you or somebody you know is interested receiving calendar invites for this meeting, please contact Sunil James. If you have a topic you'd like to present or would like to see discussed, please contact Sunil James.

## Code of Conduct
The SPIFFE community abides by the [CNCF code of conduct]. Here is an excerpt.

> _As contributors and maintainers of this project, and in the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities._
