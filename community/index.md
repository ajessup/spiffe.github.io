As an early stage project, SPIFFE is guided by a small but very active community of passionate software engineers with empathy for the problems the project will tackle. We will be opening up this community more broadly in the coming few months.

### **Stack Overflow**
Ask questions about SPIFFE using the `spiffe` tag on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spiffe).

### **Slack**
Most real-time discussions happen within SPIFFE's [Slack channel](https://spiffe.slack.com). You can join [here](https://slack.spiffe.io).

### **Mailing Lists**
Announcements occur in the following [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/spiffe.io/forum/#!forum/announce).
There is also a [users](https://groups.google.com/a/spiffe.io/forum/#!forum/user-discussion)
and [developers](https://groups.google.com/a/spiffe.io/forum/#!forum/dev-discussion) list.

### **Special Interest Groups**
The broader SPIFFE community is self-organized into Special Interest Groups (SIGs) that coordinate to manage specific aspects of SPIFFE's design. A list of active SIGs can be found [here](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/tree/master/community).

### **Project Governance**
SPIFFE is steered by engineers from, among others, Google, Docker, Dropbox, and **[Scytale Inc.](https://www.scytale.io)**. Project governance details can be found [here](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md)
