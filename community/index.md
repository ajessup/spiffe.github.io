As an early stage project, SPIFFE is guided by a small but active community of invited design partners. We will be opening up this community more broadly in the coming months.

## Meetings
The SPIFFE community at-large gets together on the last Friday of each calendar month from 10:30-2:00pm PST (Map that to your local time with this [timezone table](https://www.google.com/search?q=1030+am+in+pst)). While such meetings can be attended via video/audio, we encourage community members to join in-person, as well. If you or somebody you know is interested receiving calendar invites for this meeting, please contact [Sunil James](https://twitter.com/sunubunu).

## Social Media
SPIFFE has a burgeoning social media presence. We encourage you to follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SPIFFEio) feed.

## Slack
Most real-time discussions happen within SPIFFE's [Slack channel](https://spiffe.slack.com).

## Mailing Lists
Development announcements and discussions appear in the following [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/spiffe.io/forum/#!forum/dev-discussion) (send e-mail to `dev-discussion@spiffe.io`).

## Project Governance
SPIFFE was initially proposed by Joe Beda. The majority of its development has been sponsored by [Scytale](https://scytale.io/). We would also like to acknowledge early contributions by engineers from Google, Docker, Dropbox and Twillio.

SPIFFE is an independent project and not controlled by any single company. As the project matures, our long term ambition is to place SPIFFE under the governance of an independent foundation such as the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.
