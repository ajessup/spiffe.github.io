As an early stage project, SPIFFE is guided by a small but very active community of passionate software engineers with empathy for the problems the project will tackle. We will be opening up this community more broadly in the coming few months.

#### Meetings
The SPIFFE community at-large gets together on the last Friday of each calendar month from 10:30-2:00pm PST (Map that to your local time with this [timezone table](https://www.google.com/search?q=1030+am+in+pst)). While such meetings can be attended via video/audio, we encourage community members to join in-person, as well. If you or somebody you know is interested receiving calendar invites for this meeting, please contact [Sunil James](https://twitter.com/sunubunu).

## Project Governance
SPIFFE was initially proposed by Joe Beda and is since steered by a committee of engineers from Google, Docker, Dropbox and Twillio and others. This committe is organised into a set of Special Interest Groups that coordinate to manage specific aspects of SPIFFE's design. 

Logistical support for the SPIFFE project is provided by Scytale Inc. As the project matures, our long term ambition is to place SPIFFE under the governance of an independent foundation such as the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.
