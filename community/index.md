As an early stage project, SPIFFE is guided by a small but very active community of passionate software engineers with empathy for the problems the project will tackle. We will be opening up this community more broadly in the coming few months.

**Want to get involved? [Learn more](https://goo.gl/forms/4fJOQ3HdM4M3L27r1) about becoming a SPIFFE design partner.**

### **Meetings**
The SPIFFE community at-large gathers on the last Friday of each calendar month from 10:30-2:00pm PST (Map that to your local time with this [timezone table](https://www.google.com/search?q=1030+am+in+pst)). While such meetings can be attended via video/audio, we encourage community members to join in-person, as well. If you or somebody you know is interested in receiving calendar invites for this meeting, please complete [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/4fJOQ3HdM4M3L27r1).

### **Stack Overflow**
Ask questions about SPIFFE using the `spiffe` tag on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spiffe).

### **Social Media**
Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/SPIFFEio).

### **Slack**
Most real-time discussions happen within SPIFFE's [Slack channel](https://spiffe.slack.com).

### **Mailing Lists**
Development announcements and discussions appear in the following [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/spiffe.io/forum/#!forum/dev-discussion) (send e-mail to `dev-discussion@spiffe.io`).

### **Project Governance**
SPIFFE is steered by engineers from, among others, Google, Docker, Dropbox, and **[Scytale Inc.](https://www.scytale.io)** (SPIFFE's official maintainer). The broader group is self-organized into Special Interest Groups (SIGs) that coordinate to manage specific aspects of SPIFFE's design. As the project matures and gains traction, we hope to eventually home the project within the governance of an independent foundation, such as the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://cncf.io).
