# Community

As an early stage project, SPIFFE is guided by a small but very
active community of passionate software engineers with empathy for
the problems the project will tackle. We will be opening up this
community more broadly in the coming few months.

## Contributing

* **Mailing Lists** Announcements occur in the following
[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/spiffe.io/forum/#!forum/announce).
