The SPIFFE project is under active development, and is currently guided by a select [community]({{site.baseurl}}/community/) of enterprises who are currently facing the challenges SPIFFE attempts to tackle.

This page provides an index to the various whitepapers and design documents that have been proposed by the SPIFFE community.

 - [SPIFFE Whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GjurNK2ROw4rXz-k-l68JtpGRkGj2fZcWqP6gksEriQ/edit#heading=h.pq1kki84bhak) the original proposal for SPIFFE, presented at GlueCon 2016.

 - [SPIFFE VSID specification](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kP4Vm0_AJ4ZXPtmKH_nQNtvdydiKNDyX05gXM6fOHV0/edit) (May 2017, under active development) - a detailed specification for the [Verifiable Service Identity Document]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/vsid/), a combination of naming format, X.509 certificate format and set of trusted root bundles. This allows two bundles with a common trust root to securely identify each other.
