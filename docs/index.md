The SPIFFE project is being actively developed by a [community]({{site.baseurl}}/community/) of developers who are currently facing the challenges SPIFFE attempts to tackle. This page provides an index to various documents that have been proposed by these developers. 
     
 - The **[SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document (SVID)](https://github.com/spiffe/spiffe/tree/master/standards)** is a specification detailing a combination of naming format, X.509 certificate format, and trusted root bundle sets. This allows two (2) bundles with a common trust root to securely identify each other. _(Under active development)_
     
     
- The **[SPIFFE Reference Implementation (SRI)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RZnBfj8I5xs8Yi_BPEKBRp0K3UnIJYTDg_31rfTt4j8)** details an open-source software stack that allows for provisioning and managing SPIFFE identities across varying platforms. The SRI implements the SPIFFE Workload API. _(Under active development)_


 - The **[SPIFFE whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GjurNK2ROw4rXz-k-l68JtpGRkGj2fZcWqP6gksEriQ)** is SPIFFE's original proposal, as first presented at [GlueCon 2016](http://gluecon.com). _(Superseded by the above documents)_
