                Modern production environments are becoming increasingly hetergenous and dynamic - creating significant
                challenges in reliably and effectively securing them at scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                Central to solving this challenge is a framework for securely identifying a workload, wherever it may
                be running in a production system. Such a framework should solve for:
                <ul>
                    <li></li>
                    <li></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Inspired by similar efforts at organisations such as Google, Dropbox and Netflix, the SPIFFE project provides both
                a specification for, and a reference implementation of, such a framework.

                Specifically, workloads are being dynamically placed and scaled (often via container orchestration).  At the same time, parts of applications are being broken out as micro-services and being reused widely across larger organizations.  Security systems and processes need to adapt to this more fluid environment
